This is the initial individuals of 30 different runs with 30 different seeds. This is different than other because in this setup there are no random initialized individuals.

Problem: EnergyPLANProblemAalborg2ObjectivesWith1EnergyPLANEvolution (modified to work without PP and boiler capacity, now, the number of decision variable is 5. The file will be found in initilization folder)

The initial populations are generated by maxmising diversity. That means add the individual that maximize the deversity rather than remove the individual which contribute least.
