Here, in this folder the result of deversity maximization is investigated. In this regards, new Pareto-front is generated. And the results is compared with other approach (the approach proposed in ASOC paper).

Folder description:
Pareto front: contain Pareto-front

NSGAII_WithoutRM_DivMax_Conf1: Contain the indicator results of NSGAII (with SI) Without random initialized silutions with diversity maximization with configuration 1 (refer to folder: C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\NSGAIIWithoutTrackWithSI\WithoutRM\DivMax\Configuration 1)

NSGAII_WithoutRM_DivMax_Conf2: Contain the indicator results of NSGAII (with SI) Without random initialized silutions with diversity maximization with configuration 2 (refer to folder: C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\NSGAIIWithoutTrackWithSI\WithoutRM\DivMax\Configuration 2)

NSGAII_WithoutRM_DivMax_Conf3: Contain the indicator results of NSGAII (with SI) Without random initialized silutions with diversity maximization with configuration 3 (refer to folder: C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\NSGAIIWithoutTrackWithSI\WithoutRM\DivMax\Configuration 3)

SPEA2_WithoutRM_DivMax_Conf1: Contain the indicator results of SPEA2 (with SI) Without random initialized silutions with diversity maximization with configuration 1 (refer to folder: C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\SPEA2WithoutTrackWithSI\WithoutRM\DivMax\Configuration 1)

SPEA2_WithoutRM_DivMax_Conf2: Contain the indicator results of SPEA2 (with SI) Without random initialized silutions with diversity maximization with configuration 2 (refer to folder: C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\SPEA2WithoutTrackWithSI\WithoutRM\DivMax\Configuration 2)

SPEA2_WithoutRM_DivMax_Conf3: Contain the indicator results of SPEA2 (with SI) Without random initialized silutions with diversity maximization with configuration 3 (refer to folder: C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\SPEA2WithoutTrackWithSI\WithoutRM\DivMax\Configuration 3)

NSGAII_WithoutRM_SI: It the result of NSGAII with smart initialization result (report in ASOC paper, mutation probability 0.1), we take all FUN files (refer to C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\NSGAIIWithoutTrackWithSI\WithoutRM folder, mutation probability 0.1), because we want to calculate indicators' value with respect to new Pareto-front. And we do not want to delete those indicators' values which are reported in ASOC paper.

SPEA2_WithoutRM_SI: It the result of SPEA2 with smart initialization result (report in ASOC paper, mutation probability 0.1), we take all FUN files (refer to C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\SPEA2WithoutTrackWithSI\WithoutRM folder, mutation probability 0.1), because we want to calculate indicators' value with respect to new Pareto-front. And we do not want to delete those indicators' values which are reported in ASOC paper.


NSGAII: it is the results of NSGAII with default configuration (see readme file inside the folder), we take all FUN file (refer to C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\NSGAIIWithoutTrack folder with mutation probability 0.1), because we want to calculate indicators' value with respect to new Pareto-front. And we do not want to delete those indicators' values which are reported in ASOC paper.

SPEA2: it is the results of SPEA2 with default configuration (see readme file inside the folder), we take all FUN file(refer to C:\Users\mahbub\Documents\GitHub\EnergyPLANDomainKnowledgeEAStep1\InitializationResults\SPEA2WithoutTrack folder with mutation probability 0.1), because we want to calculate indicators' value with respect to new Pareto-front. And we do not want to delete those indicators' values which are reported in ASOC paper.
