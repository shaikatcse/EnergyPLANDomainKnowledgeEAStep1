This is the results of 10 different runs with 10 different seed.
SBX & Polynomial Mutation is used.

Population: 100
Evolution: 5000
crossover Probabilty: 0.9
Mutation probability: 0.2
Distribution index: 4
Algorithm: NSGA-II
selection: Binary Tournament 2.

seed [] = {545782, 455875, 547945, 458478, 981354, 652262, 562366, 365652, 456545, 549235 };

Now this simutation will run track the evolution of hypervolume.
