This is the results of 10 different runs with 10 different seed.
Here mutation based on domain knowledge (modified polynomial mutation) is applies with SBX crossover.

It mutation is designed to work in 3 stages.

mutation probability of applying different types of mutation (RE favor, CE favor, generic mutataion) depends of generation. In the early generation, two favor mutation is moslt applied, after some generation the probability goes down and the probability of applying generic mutation goes up.
